# Vision based ID Reader

The objective of the project is to read and store data from an ID Card using a camera using OCR. The OCR package used here is pyocr.

The front of the ID card contains Registration Number and Name of the student which is what we aim to extract. 
The OCR dumps all kinds of data, which we clean by means of Regex and stored in a file named data.txt
